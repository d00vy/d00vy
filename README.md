# hello-world
First ever github repo.

Hello humans,
 
d00vy here, writing some BS into a readme.md file to see how branching and commits work within github.
I'm currently learning how github works, and trying to find how I can apply it to my needs.

My interests at the moment are in web development, and my first project will be creating a new-tab/start page for myself.
